# Audio Transcription & Diary Note Generation System

## Implementation Overview

This document provides a summary of the implemented ML inference pipeline for audio transcription and diary note generation.

### Core Architecture

1. **Microservices Design**
   - Independent services for ingestion, transcription, LLM processing and status tracking
   - Redis pub/sub for asynchronous job processing
   - PostgreSQL for metadata storage
   - Local storage or GCS for file persistence

2. **Scalability Features**
   - Horizontal scaling with queue-based workers
   - Priority-based job routing
   - GPU support for Whisper transcription
   - Automatic fallback mechanisms

3. **Containerization**
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
     - Base: Common dependencies
     - Development: Dev tools and debugging
     - Production: Optimized and minimal
     - GPU: CUDA support for Whisper
   - Resource constraints and health checks

4. **Observability**
   - Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards
   - OpenTelemetry tracing with Jaeger
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Comprehensive health checks

5. **LLM Provider Support**
   - OpenAI GPT models (primary)
   - Anthropic Claude models (secondary)
   - Mistral AI models (tertiary)
   - Local models for complete fallback

6. **Security**
   - API key management
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Error handling

7. **DevOps**
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Kubernetes deployment manifests
   - Terraform infrastructure for GCP
   - Comprehensive test suite

### Processing Pipeline

1. User submits job to Ingestion API with audio URL
2. Transcription worker downloads audio and processes with Whisper
3. LLM worker converts transcription to diary notes using multi-provider router
4. Job Status API provides results and progress tracking

### Highlights

- **Intelligent LLM Router**: Multi-provider support with automatic fallbacks and retry logic
- **Observability**: Full tracing from request to completion
- **Local-First Design**: Works completely locally with optional cloud deployment
- **Production-Grade**: Monitoring, scaling and reliability built-in

### Future Improvements

- Enhanced caching of processed audio segments
- Multi-region deployments
- Streaming transcription for long files
- Custom model fine-tuning for better diary generation
